The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is a quantum algorithm designed to determine whether a given Boolean function is constant (produces the same output for all inputs) or balanced (produces an equal number of 0s and 1s for all possible inputs). This algorithm showcases the power of quantum computing by solving this problem exponentially faster than any classical algorithm.

Scenario
Imagine you have a black-box function (oracle) that takes an (n)-bit input and returns either 0 or 1. The function is guaranteed to be either constant or balanced. The goal is to determine which type it is with the least number of queries to the oracle.

Classical vs. Quantum Approach
Classical Approach: In the worst case, you would need to query the function (2^{n-1} + 1) times to be sure whether it is constant or balanced.
Quantum Approach: The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can determine the nature of the function with just one query to the oracle.
Steps in the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
Initialization:
Start with (n) qubits in the state (|0\rangle) and one qubit in the state (|1\rangle).
Apply a Hadamard gate to all (n+1) qubits.
Oracle Query:
Apply the oracle function, which flips the phase of the state based on the functionâ€™s output.
Interference:
Apply a Hadamard gate to the first (n) qubits again.
Measurement:
Measure the first (n) qubits. If the result is (|0\rangle) for all qubits, the function is constant. Otherwise, it is balanced.# Deutsch-Jozsa
